## Clone With Rockwall Cubes
Soak rockwall circle cubes in a CloneEX Clone Solution at 20ml per gallon of water(or one packet). Clone nicer bigger top branches for faster vegatation time but smalls are okay if they are in good light. Cut branch and trim off bottom leaves and branch node sites leaving tops. Take cut branch and place in water cup. Cut a 45 degree cut at or on a bottom branch node site. Immediately dip cutting in CloneEx rooting gel. Soak for 5-30 seconds. Then stick cutting in rockwall gently without squeezing to tight. After all propagations are made gently put on dome lid. Make sure lights are on for 24hrs and at good height depending on how many lights are used. Need lower light or a higher light help. Enviroment needs to be a steady temp a 79-80 Degrees.
