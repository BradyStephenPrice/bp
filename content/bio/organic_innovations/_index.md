#### **Introduction**

The story of **Organic Innovations** begins with a vision to revolutionize the cannabis industry by integrating sustainability, organic farming methods, and innovative breeding techniques. The founder’s journey from a small hemp farm to managing large-scale operations is not only a testament to their expertise in farming but also to their dedication to creating a positive impact in the cannabis sector and beyond. Organic Innovations, with its organic methods and cutting-edge agricultural techniques, has helped lead the way in cannabis cultivation, leaving a mark on the industry and empowering communities along the way. This is the story of a remarkable individual who helped change the landscape of cannabis farming, while also nurturing relationships with Native American communities and proving that they could compete with the best in the business.

#### **The Beginning: Building Organic Innovations**

The idea for **Organic Innovations** was born from a desire to work in harmony with nature and embrace the power of organic farming to produce high-quality cannabis. The founder of Organic Innovations started with a simple mission: to grow cannabis in a way that was environmentally responsible, deeply rooted in the principles of sustainability, and most importantly, beneficial to the end consumer. Their approach to cannabis farming centered on providing the highest-quality hemp flower biomass without compromising on the land or surrounding ecosystem.

Starting with a small five-acre farm, the founder set out to grow cannabis using only organic methods, opting for practices that would ensure a healthy and thriving plant without the use of harmful chemicals or synthetic fertilizers. Their farm became a showcase for what it means to grow cannabis responsibly, and as the plants flourished, so too did the reputation of the farm. From the very beginning, the founder placed an emphasis on sustainable practices, ensuring that the cannabis they grew was not only safe and healthy for the consumer but also for the earth.

#### **Leading the Way with Organic Methods**

As Organic Innovations began to gain traction, the founder faced a unique set of challenges that required them to think outside the box. One of the most impressive achievements of the farm was the cultivation of **20,000 dry flower biomass** from just five acres of land—a feat that would have been difficult to imagine for many farmers. The key to this success lay in the use of organic farming methods that focused on the health of the soil, the plants, and the surrounding environment.

One of the unique aspects of Organic Innovations’ operation was its partnership with **Sunrise Genetics**, which brought a scientific edge to the farm's growing process. Through **genetic breeding** techniques, Sunrise Genetics helped the farm achieve a **three-fold increase in plant genetics**, leading to stronger, healthier cannabis plants. These plants not only yielded more biomass but were also more resistant to pests and diseases, reducing the need for pesticides or chemical interventions. This was a significant achievement for a farm that prided itself on being fully organic.

The founder took pride in being deeply involved at every stage of the process, from **clone to harvest**. They took the time to carefully monitor and care for each plant, ensuring that the cannabis was grown under ideal conditions. Their hands-on approach ensured that every part of the process was managed with the utmost care and precision. As a result, the farm consistently produced high-quality biomass that set it apart from others in the region.

#### **Expanding to Large-Scale Operations**

As demand for the farm’s products grew, so did the size of the operation. The founder's expertise, combined with a relentless drive for success, eventually led them to take on larger, more complex farming projects. The next phase of growth saw Organic Innovations expanding to an **80-acre farm**, which required significant planning, technology, and advanced irrigation systems to ensure the crops thrived.

This larger operation was powered by an **1000-gallon-per-hour water pivot**, a crucial piece of equipment that helped efficiently irrigate the massive land area. The founder’s technical know-how and background in farming proved invaluable as they oversaw the installation and operation of this equipment, which allowed them to maintain the health and productivity of the crops with a focus on water conservation.

Perhaps one of the most impressive feats of this expansion was the **seeding of the 80-acre farm**. The founder took the reins of the process, overseeing every step of planting. One of the highlights of this operation was the use of a **2160 R John Deere tractor** equipped with **GPS** technology to ensure precision planting across the vast landscape. This was a large-scale, high-tech farming operation that would have been difficult for most farmers to navigate, but the founder’s expertise and leadership turned it into a smooth and successful endeavor.

Despite the scale of the operation, the founder maintained their commitment to **organic principles**. Even as they scaled up, they ensured that every decision made on the farm—whether related to water usage, soil health, or pest management—aligned with their original vision of creating a sustainable, high-quality cannabis operation. This unwavering commitment to organic methods allowed Organic Innovations to remain true to its core values while growing its footprint in the cannabis industry.

#### **Giving Back: Helping Native Communities**

While growing Organic Innovations, the founder’s journey also led them to make a significant impact on **Native American communities**, particularly in **Wounded Knee, South Dakota**. For four years, the founder worked closely with the people of Wounded Knee, providing agricultural expertise and knowledge to help local farmers establish their own operations. Their work was not just about farming cannabis; it was about empowering the community and offering opportunities for economic growth through agriculture.

This partnership demonstrated the founder’s broader vision of creating social value through sustainable farming. By teaching farming techniques, sharing knowledge about organic agriculture, and helping to create self-sufficient farms, the founder helped bring new opportunities to a community in need. It was a long-term commitment that had a lasting impact on the people they worked with, helping to cultivate not just crops but also hope and opportunity in the region.

The founder’s time working in Wounded Knee also gave them the opportunity to connect with Native American leaders and learn about their rich agricultural traditions. This experience added a new layer of depth to their understanding of farming and cultivated a sense of purpose in their work. It was a reminder that farming, especially in the cannabis industry, is not just about profits but about creating a positive impact on communities and the environment.

#### **Recognized as a Leader in the Cannabis Industry**

The success of Organic Innovations, along with the founder’s innovative approach to farming, quickly garnered attention in the cannabis industry. Their ability to combine **organic farming techniques with advanced agricultural technology** set them apart from many of their competitors. As Organic Innovations grew, the founder earned a reputation as one of the top cannabis farmers in the region, recognized for their expertise, commitment to quality, and ability to grow cannabis at scale while maintaining organic practices.

This recognition eventually led to a career-defining opportunity: the **head cultivation job at Rocket Farms** in California. The offer was a testament to the founder’s skills and reputation within the cannabis industry. It marked a new chapter in their career, filled with new challenges and adventures. Rocket Farms, a large-scale operation known for its high-quality cannabis cultivation, was an ideal fit for the founder, who had proven time and again that they could grow cannabis with the best of them.

#### **Legacy and Future**

Looking back on their journey, the founder of Organic Innovations has achieved more than just farming success—they have become a leader in the cannabis industry and a mentor to other farmers who wish to grow with integrity. From their early days on the five-acre hemp farm to their role as a leader in large-scale operations, the founder has consistently demonstrated that organic farming and innovation can coexist in the cannabis industry.

Their journey is far from over. As they continue their work with Rocket Farms and beyond, the founder remains committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in cannabis farming. They understand that the future of the industry lies in innovation, sustainability, and a deep respect for the land.
