**Building a One-of-a-Kind Cannabis Harvester: A Unique Project in Agricultural Innovation**

As someone who is passionate about both cannabis cultivation and the intricacies of agricultural machinery, I embarked on a truly unique and ambitious project: creating a custom cannabis harvester with Shelborne from England. This machine would not only revolutionize the way cannabis is harvested but also be a testament to my creativity and problem-solving skills. The goal was to design and build a harvester that could strip cannabis flowers from the stems of the plants efficiently and gently. The result would be a versatile, high-performing machine tailored specifically to the delicate needs of cannabis farming.

The project began with a partnership with Shelbourne, a highly respected manufacturer based in England, known for their expertise in custom agricultural equipment. They helped bring my vision to life by crafting an 8-foot right-hand auger header — the first and only one of its kind in the world. The auger header would serve as the key component for harvesting cannabis, as it would gently strip the flowers from the stems and pull the plant flowers and leaves into the machine, then using the auger to gently push the material on to a custom belt, that would move the material into a trailer. This step was crucial, as the flowers must be harvested without causing damage and brusing, which is a challenge when working with the fragile flower buds of cannabis plants.

The design of the auger header was carefully thought out to ensure that the harvesting process would be as efficient and gentle as possible. Traditional harvesting machines often damage the flowers, leading to wasted product and lower-quality yields. However, by customizing the header’s teeth and auger system, I was able to develop a solution that could delicately strip the flower buds while leaving the stems intact in the ground. This was a game-changer, as it allowed for the flowers to be moved onto the belt system without any unnecessary handling or stress, preserving their quality for further processing.

Once I had the header designed, I turned my attention to adapting it for use with a variety of loaders. The challenge was to create a versatile attachment system that would allow the auger header to be easily mounted onto any loader trackor, making the harvester adaptable to different environments and scales of production. I customized the attachment mechanism so that the header could be quickly and securely connected to various types of loaders, whether they were small, medium, or large-scale machines. This flexibility ensures that the harvester could be used for a wide range of applications, from small boutique farms to larger industrial operations.

The next step was integrating the auger header with a larger Bobcat tractor. I designed a custom bumper holder to attach the harvester to the tractor, making sure that everything was securely fastened and ready for action. To further enhance the functionality, I created an attachment plate specifically designed to connect the conveyor belt system to the auger header. This allowed the harvested cannabis flowers to be moved onto the belt, where they would then travel up into a dump trailer for easy transport. The entire setup was designed to create a continuous, seamless flow from harvesting to storage, ensuring that the system operated smoothly from start to finish.

One of the most crucial components of the design was the custom conveyor belt system. Cannabis flowers are delicate, and traditional harvesting methods often lead to damage or loss of product during transport. To avoid this, I added protective sides and bumpers around the belt, ensuring that the flowers would be moved safely without falling off or becoming damaged. The bumpers prevented the flowers from getting caught or jostled, while the sides kept the flowers securely on track as they were conveyed to the trailer.

Another important feature was the custom-designed teeth on the auger header. These teeth were carefully engineered to strip the flowers from the stems without causing any harm to the delicate buds. Traditional harvesting machines often fail to achieve this delicate balance, causing the flowers to be crushed or damaged during the stripping process. However, with the custom teeth, I was able to create a system that effectively separated the flowers from the stems, while keeping the buds intact and in top condition for processing. As the flowers were stripped from the plants, the auger would move them onto the conveyor belt, which would then transport them up into the dump trailer.

The custom cannabis harvester I designed is more than just a machine; it’s a solution to the specific challenges faced by cannabis cultivators. The versatility of the design allows the harvester to be used with different types of equipment, while the custom modifications ensure that the flowers are handled with care. From the specialized auger header to the adaptable loader attachment system, every aspect of the machine was designed with efficiency, gentleness, and ease of use in mind. This harvester is the perfect blend of innovative engineering and practical functionality, making it a game-changer for anyone looking to streamline their cannabis harvesting process.

In addition to its technical features, the harvester is a testament to the power of customization. By carefully considering every aspect of the machine’s design and tailoring it to meet the specific needs of cannabis cultivation, I was able to create a tool that is not only efficient but also perfectly suited to the unique challenges of the cannabis industry. From the initial concept to the final product, the project has been a labor of love, and I’m incredibly proud of the result. It’s a machine that combines cutting-edge technology with practical solutions, and it’s a true one-of-a-kind harvester that will make cannabis harvesting faster, easier, and more effective than ever before.
