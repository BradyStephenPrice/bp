### Story: Revolutionizing Hemp Farming with the Orkel Tracker Baler

In the ever-evolving world of hemp farming, innovation and efficiency are key to staying ahead. For one ambitious hemp farmer, the next leap forward came from an unexpected but game-changing collaboration with **Orkel**, a Norwegian company known for their innovative agricultural machinery. The farmer, already deeply immersed in the world of hemp cultivation, never anticipated that the next step in improving their operations would come from the introduction of a **zero-oxygen baler**—a revolutionary tool designed to enhance preservation and quality control in baled crops.

This is the story of how a unique partnership with Orkel and the introduction of their **Orkel Tracker Baler**, combined with a customized hemp program, changed the way they farmed hemp.

#### **A Chance Meeting with Orkel’s Owner**

It all began when the **owner of Orkel**, a visionary figure in the agricultural machinery world, made a visit to the farmer’s property. Orkel is renowned for its cutting-edge baling technology, particularly their **zero-oxygen balers**, which were initially designed to preserve feed and forage by reducing the oxygen levels inside the bale, significantly extending the freshness and quality of the crop. With the hemp industry booming and the demand for high-quality, long-lasting products, the opportunity to incorporate this technology into hemp farming seemed like the perfect fit.

Orkel’s baling machines were already used around the world in various agricultural sectors, but the farmer saw an opportunity to take it one step further. The idea was simple: **adapt Orkel’s technology for hemp**, where maintaining the crop’s quality post-harvest is essential for extracting potent cannabinoids and maintaining a premium product. The farmer had already been exploring ways to optimize their hemp production process, but this conversation would open a whole new realm of possibilities.

During their visit, the Orkel owner and the farmer began discussing how the **Orkel Tracker Baler**—with its ability to drastically reduce oxygen within the bales—could be used to preserve the **freshness of hemp biomass** while it was in storage. By eliminating oxygen from the bale, the natural degradation process would be slowed down, helping the hemp to retain its potency and aroma, something critical for both CBD and THC-rich hemp. This technological advancement held the promise of dramatically improving the quality and shelf-life of hemp biomass, which in turn could lead to better product consistency in the end market.

#### **Introducing Dinaminica Generale and the Hemp Program**

But the collaboration didn’t end there. As the conversation progressed, the Orkel owner introduced the farmer to a unique piece of software called **Dinaminica Generale**. This sophisticated program was designed to work in conjunction with the Orkel Tracker Baler, providing a platform for data analytics and farm management. The system would allow the farmer to track important variables during the baling process, such as moisture levels, bale density, and temperature, all of which are critical when handling delicate crops like hemp.

The software could be integrated directly into the Orkel Tracker Baler, allowing for real-time adjustments and accurate monitoring. With this data, the farmer would have the ability to **optimize their baling process** to suit the specific needs of hemp, helping to ensure that the bales were compact, properly preserved, and perfectly suited for further processing. This was the kind of technology-driven approach the farmer had been seeking to elevate their hemp operation.

The introduction of Dinaminica Generale offered a clear advantage: not only could the farmer track the performance of each baler in real-time, but the software also provided predictive insights based on ongoing data. The farmer could now make informed decisions about harvesting, storage, and processing, significantly enhancing their overall efficiency.

#### **Customizing the Baler for Hemp**

As the discussions continued, the need for **specialized equipment** to cater specifically to the hemp industry became clear. While the Orkel Tracker Baler was a remarkable piece of machinery, the hemp industry has its own unique demands—particularly when it comes to processing and handling. The hemp plant is different from traditional forage crops like hay or alfalfa. Hemp stalks are thicker, and the flowers require careful handling to preserve their delicate properties.

This led to a more in-depth conversation about a **custom-built solution**—a baler that would be specifically designed for the hemp market. The farmer worked with Orkel’s engineers to explore the possibility of creating a smaller version of the Tracker Baler, one that could handle smaller-scale operations and be adaptable for different types of hemp crops. 

This was where the concept of a **frozen baler**—a baler that could preserve the crop’s quality by freezing it at the point of baling—was introduced. Freezing hemp biomass immediately after harvest would lock in the cannabinoids and terpenes, ensuring the product was preserved in its prime state before being processed. This approach had not been used in the hemp industry before, and the farmer’s request for a **custom frozen baler** presented an exciting challenge for Orkel’s team.

Working together, the Orkel engineers and the farmer mapped out a plan for this unique baling solution. The key was in creating a mechanism that would not only bale the hemp efficiently but also incorporate freezing capabilities that could work within the baler itself. This custom baler would be able to adjust to the specific needs of the hemp industry, ensuring that the bales were **preserved at peak quality** and could be stored for longer periods without compromising the integrity of the biomass.

The vision was ambitious, but it became clear that this collaboration had the potential to revolutionize the way hemp farmers processed and stored their crops.

#### **The Future of Hemp Farming: Efficiency and Quality Control**

As the partnership between the farmer and Orkel continued to develop, it became evident that this technological innovation would play a pivotal role in the future of hemp farming. The combination of the **Orkel Tracker Baler**, the **Dinaminica Generale** software, and the custom **hemp-specific modifications** to the baler would not only improve the quality of the product but also streamline the entire harvesting and storage process.

The zero-oxygen baling technology, combined with the ability to freeze and preserve hemp, offered significant benefits for farmers seeking to maintain the potency and aroma of their crops while also maximizing efficiency. This approach could potentially increase profitability for farmers by ensuring that their hemp stayed fresh for longer periods, reducing waste and lowering the cost of processing. It was a solution that would be especially valuable for those growing hemp for **CBD extraction** or for the **production of high-quality cannabinoids**.

Beyond the machinery itself, the collaboration signaled a broader trend in the industry: the push towards **data-driven farming** and the use of advanced technology to optimize crop management. By integrating precision farming techniques with custom-built equipment, farmers were given the tools they needed to increase both the quality and quantity of their yields.

#### **Conclusion**

What started as a simple conversation between the Orkel owner and a hemp farmer in need of better baling solutions has now evolved into a partnership that promises to redefine the future of hemp farming. Through **innovative technology**, a tailored approach to **baling and storage**, and the introduction of the **Dinaminica Generale software**, the farmer was able to enhance every step of the process—from the field to the final product. The customized balers—designed with hemp in mind—would forever change the way the farmer managed their crops, improving both efficiency and product quality.

As the farmer looks to the future, the innovations born from this collaboration will no doubt continue to shape the landscape of hemp farming, helping to set new industry standards for quality, sustainability, and profitability. And it all started with a visit from the Orkel owner, a shared vision, and the willingness to embrace technology in order to push the boundaries of what hemp farming could become.
