**A Journey to Cultivation Mastery at Organic Alternatives**

It was a crisp morning in Fort Collins, Colorado, when my career in the cannabis industry took a life-changing turn. I had been working in agriculture for years, learning the ropes of sustainable farming, but I never imagined that one day I’d be leading a team at one of the premier dispensaries in downtown Fort Collins — Organic Alternatives. This dispensary, located in the heart of Colorado’s cannabis culture, was no ordinary operation. It was a high-end dispensary with an ambiance that blended old-world charm with modern sophistication, featuring a fancy, old bar-style display countertop that displayed some of the best organic cannabis in the area. As the only dispensary in downtown Fort Collins, it was at the forefront of the burgeoning cannabis industry, and I had just been offered the position of **Head Cultivation Manager**. It was a dream job that would fast-track my knowledge and experience in the cannabis industry in ways I could never have imagined.

### **The Call That Changed Everything**

 I had been working in agriculture, focused on traditional crops and small-scale growing operations, but my passion for plant cultivation — particularly cannabis —. The owner at Organic Alternatives suggested I come look at the job for the position of Head Cultivation Manager, telling me that they are in need of someone who could help ramp up production. The job seemed like a perfect fit, but I had no idea what it would entail.

 They shared their vision for the business, from the fancy in-house bar-style display to the incredible different strains of organic cannabis they were offering. This wasn’t just any dispensary — Organic Alternatives was focused on delivering high-quality, premium cannabis to its customers. The dispensary prided itself on having high-end, organic cannabis that was grown with care, and it catered to a sophisticated clientele who appreciated the unique flavors and therapeutic properties of the plants.

Despite my experience in agriculture, I was known for the best garder around. With years of quanity. 

### **Getting Started: A Crash Course in Cannabis Cultivation**

From the moment I stepped into the cultivation facility, I realized I was about to embark on a journey unlike any I had experienced. The dispensary’s growing operation was located in a large warehouse just outside downtown, and it was a beehive of activity. I was now in charge of the grow department, overseeing everything from seed to harvest. The team I inherited was a passionate, driven group, but there were challenges ahead. The goal was clear: increase production. Organic Alternatives had been producing around **330 pounds of cannabis per year**, but they didnt know that i could get them to a number of **1,500 pounds** in just one year. With every strin over 20% THC and some as high as 32% THC. We harvest every 16 days with a 16 day plant move at 84 harvest a year.

I optimized the growing conditions, and building problems with the best techniques for maximizing yields without sacrificing quality. The facility operated with **fully tracked state systems** that monitored every step of the process, from planting to waste disposal. I learned about the complex systems for tracking plants and waste — an essential part of maintaining compliance with the state’s cannabis regulations and fire department.

In addition to learning about cannabis genetics and cultivation practices, I quickly had to dive deep into pest management, fungi, bacteria, and other common agricultural challenges. The cannabis plant is particularly sensitive to environmental changes. I became a fast learner when it came to identifying the signs of bacterial infections, fungal growth, or insect damage, and I put together a robust preventative strategy for all the plants under my care. I was constantly experimenting with new techniques and staying up to date on the latest agricultural research.

### **Building a Team and Boosting Production**

At the same time, I was building a team. Organic Alternatives was growing fast, and we needed to expand our operations. I walked into a team of growers, each with their own strengths and expertise, and we worked together to streamline the cultivation process. We also established a hand trimmer harvest team, a joint roller team, and a packing team, each responsible for a specific part of the operation.

Our goal was to deliver a product that not only met the high standards of Organic Alternatives but exceeded them. One of the key aspects of our operation was ensuring the **quality** of every product, from the flowers to the concentrates. The dispensary prided itself on offering **54 different flavors of cannabis** — each with its own distinct aroma, taste, and therapeutic effects. Our flower was top-tier, and the joints we hand-rolled were designed to reflect the same quality. We also produced high-quality butane oil concentrates that were sold for premium prices, with some grams retailing at **$60**. The quality control and attention to detail that went into every product were paramount.

Through constant monitoring, refinement, and careful cultivation techniques, we started seeing results. Within the first few months, I had already boosted production significantly, but it was a marathon, not a sprint. By the end of the year, we had surpassed our initial goal. Production had grown from **330 pounds** to **1,500 pounds**, and the quality remained impeccable. We were now producing a steady stream of high-quality cannabis that was sold out almost immediately.

### **The Green Rush: A Thriving Industry in Full Swing**

As our production increased, so did the demand. The **Green Rush** was in full swing in Colorado, and people were flocking from all over the United States to experience the legal, regulated cannabis market. Downtown Fort Collins, with its charm and vibrant atmosphere, became a hub for cannabis enthusiasts. Organic Alternatives became a go-to destination for high-end cannabis products, and people lined up to purchase our premium flowers, joints, and concentrates. We were now selling our **1/8 oz packages at $60**, which reflected the high-end nature of our offerings.

The success of Organic Alternatives was a combination of several factors: our commitment to quality, our unique selection of **54 different cannabis strains**, and our ability to scale up production without compromising on the product. As Head Cultivation Manager, I had learned an immense amount in a short amount of time, and I became more and more passionate about the agricultural side of cannabis production. Every day was a new learning opportunity, and every day I grew more fascinated with the plant’s intricacies.

Our dispensary became a cornerstone of the downtown Fort Collins community, offering top-notch products and excellent customer service. We had a loyal customer base that trusted our products, and as we expanded our operation, I continued to oversee the cultivation department with an eye on efficiency, quality, and compliance. The combination of hard work, dedication, and a bit of luck allowed us to thrive during the early years of Colorado’s cannabis market.

### **Reflection: A Career Transformed**

Looking back, my time at Organic Alternatives was a period of immense growth — both professionally and personally. The job fast-tracked my knowledge of **cannabis agriculture**, allowing me to learn about pests, fungi, bacteria, and plant health in ways that I had never encountered before. I had the unique opportunity to not only run a cultivation facility but to help guide a team of talented individuals who shared my passion for cannabis.

At the end of the day, the success of Organic Alternatives wasn’t just about the numbers. It was about the people, the dedication to quality, and the knowledge we built together. What started as a simple job offer turned into a life-changing opportunity that allowed me to contribute to the cannabis industry in ways that will last a lifetime. Organic Alternatives was more than just a dispensary to me — it was the place where my passion for cannabis cultivation truly took root, and where I learned what it truly takes to succeed in the rapidly changing cannabis world.
